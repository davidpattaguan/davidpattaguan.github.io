              <p class="resume_details_font text-justify">My road to SEAIDITE Week began with a meeting with the officers and freshman councilors. We welcomed the freshies to the family and they introduced themselves having the same goal of helping the department. It was nice to see the youngbloods join 
                us, as we prepare for the biggest event of the year. Seeing them was nostalgic because last year, I was also a freshman councilor just like them.  I got the chance to talk about my experiences last year 
                and imposed a challenge for them to do their best for this year. </p>

              <p class="resume_details_font text-justify">The council officers also had meetings with the other organizational officers regarding the theme and the different contested events of this year's SEAIDITE Day and Night 2019.
                Conflict was unavoidable but we all finally agreed to settle to the movie, NUTCRACKER and the FOUR REALMS as our main theme for this year's day and night celebration. 
                Time's moving fast and the pressure is on for us officers, as we started planning and working for the week. We all had different roles assignments. I was assigned to help John Mark in Visual Competitions
                and at the same time join the logistics for the creation of backdrop. It took us almost a month to prepare having only 2-4 hours sleep per day but we know that
                everyone of us including the other organizations were doing their best to give quality performances and designs for the audience. </p>

                organizations really exerted their effort, and I know that because I, myself is an officer. My friends are also officers of the organization. it was a great learning
                experience for everyone. </p>

                      It was a countdown for me as well as I was invited by Don,our president, to talk about Google DSC. To be honest, I find it the perfect timing
                      to officialy launch our DSC chapter and tell something about it. So I met up with my core team and started planning for the event, also keeping in mind
                      our future endeavors. They were very attentive and supportive. The next day, I started my talk about our DSC, the technological utilization in our times followed
                      by a Gsuites Essentials Seminar. The seminar/launching was a success, people learned something new and actually signed up for membership.
                      Here's a recap of the event: </p>

                  The most awaited part of the week has finally come! SEAIDITE DAY AND NIGHT! My day started off with me behind the camera, that's why I have limited pictures
                  of myself because i was also busy taking pictures and videos of the paticipants for the department. Being an officer of the department takes a lot of sacrifice and dedication. 
                  I was busy helping other officers and missed out almost every morning and afternoon events, it's kinda sad but I know for the fact the consequences of being and
                  officer. There's a problem that highlighted my day and night. JM and I were assigned to facilitate the digital events but little do we know, the venue - J43 LAB-  was not 
              properly communicated and lettered, the partcipants were there on time so we need to come up with a solution as fast as possible. </p> </div>
        
              <div class="col-lg-12 bg-primary">
                <p class="resume_details_font text-justify"> 
                With Grace under pressure, we came up
                with an alternative solution by changing the venue to the L-Hall. Lesson learned: When you are an officer, failing to plan is planning to fail. As much as you want for your event to be
                precise and accurate with the main plan, take it into consideration that if everything doesn't come into what was initially planned, you must have alternative plans as well.
                Be doubtful already if there's no problem, don't just go according to plan, find loopholes and mishaps for an immediate action. </p> </div>

                On the other hand, I was amazed on how the participants performed during the night program, they really performed their hearts out in the grand stage.
                everybody was having fun and entertained by the events. There were 2 events that made my night. The first event is the tawag ng uwian partcipated by
                the organizational presidents. I can say that amidst all problems with their own respective organization/teams they managed to show that really, they deserve
                to be the presidents of their orgs (LOL). What I love the most about that event is our org president really shook the crowd and made the gym roar wild as he performed
                his legendary bamboo song-aleluia with a bamboo stick, the audience shouted regardless of the teams making it the loudest part of the night events.  The second event is the couture,
                all the coutures were sophistically good looking. A true seaidite trademark.</p> </div>

                  The event ended up late but the event was successful. As an officer, It was fullfilling to see other people enjoy what your team had organized and prepared for weeks
                  All those problems turned into achievements but the most important thing for me is that we've learned a lot and grew from those experiences. It was not only a victory
                  for myself, but the whole seaidite department. But, there's still an unfinished buisness and a crown to defend. The mighty Dragons are back with it again!</p> </div>
